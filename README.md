# En-It_Translator

If you're looking to create a Custom GPT that focuses on high-quality translations between English and Italian, I've got the perfect setup for you. This GPT has been designed for professional-level translation, ensuring that it handles nuances like avoiding the use of the "passato remoto" tense, unless specifically requested. This GPT is already used by me and around 800 others for English-Spanish communication, and it has proven to be incredibly effective.
